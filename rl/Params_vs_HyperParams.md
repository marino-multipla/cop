# Parameters and hyperparameters in a machine learning model

Parameters and hyperparameters are two different kinds of settings in a machine learning model, and understanding the distinction between them is crucial.

1. **Parameters:**
   - **Definition:** Parameters are the internal variables that the model learns from the training data. They are the coefficients in linear regression, the weights in neural networks, or the slopes and intercepts in various other models.
   - **Learned:** These values are learned during the training process by adjusting them based on the input data to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual target values.
   - **Example:** In a simple linear regression equation \(y = mx + b\), \(m\) and \(b\) are parameters that the model learns during training.

2. **Hyperparameters:**
   - **Definition:** Hyperparameters are external configuration settings that are not learned from the data but are set prior to the training process.
   - **Not Learned:** Unlike parameters, hyperparameters are not learned from the training data. They need to be set before training begins and are usually determined through techniques like grid search or random search.
   - **Example:** In a neural network, hyperparameters include the learning rate, the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the activation functions, etc.

In summary, parameters are the internal variables that a model learns during training, while hyperparameters are external configuration settings that need to be specified before training. The learning algorithm adjusts parameters to optimize the model's performance on the training data, while hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the overall learning process.
