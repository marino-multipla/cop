# PRNG stands for Pseudo-Random Number Generator
PRNG stands for Pseudo-Random Number Generator, and it is a crucial component in many computer algorithms and simulations. When it comes to reproducibility of results, using a fixed seed for the PRNG is a common practice.

Setting a seed for the PRNG ensures that the sequence of random numbers generated is the same every time the code is run with that specific seed. This is particularly important in scientific research, simulations, or any application where repeatability of results is essential.
