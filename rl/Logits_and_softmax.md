# Logits and Softmax
In the context of machine learning and neural networks, logits are the raw, unnormalized output of a layer in a model, typically the output of the last linear layer before applying a softmax activation function. Logits are used to represent the scores or predictions for each class in a classification problem.

Let's break down the concept:

1. **Linear Layer Output:**
   In a neural network, especially in classification tasks, the final layer often consists of a linear transformation (matrix multiplication) that produces a vector of raw scores. These scores are the logits.

2. **Softmax Activation:**
   After obtaining the logits, a softmax activation function is commonly applied to convert the logits into probabilities. The softmax function exponentiates each logit and normalizes the values, ensuring that the output probabilities sum to 1. This makes the output suitable for interpreting as class probabilities.

   The softmax function is defined as follows:
   \[ \text{Softmax}(z)_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}} \]
   where \(z\) is the vector of logits, \(i\) is the index of a particular class, and \(K\) is the total number of classes.

3. **Interpretation:**
   The logits represent the model's raw prediction scores before any normalization. Higher logits for a particular class indicate a higher confidence in predicting that class. After applying softmax, the highest probability corresponds to the predicted class.

In summary, logits are the values produced by the last linear layer of a neural network before applying a softmax activation. They serve as the raw scores that are transformed into probabilities through the softmax function, providing a distribution over classes for classification tasks.

# Why i need to use softmax and not simply, for each logits dividing it by the sum of the all logits? What will be the difference?

The approach you've described, where you divide each logit by the sum of all logits without using the softmax function, is actually a valid alternative to obtain probabilities. This operation is sometimes referred to as "normalized exponential" or "normalized exponential function."

The softmax function is commonly used due to its convenient properties and interpretation. The main reason to use softmax is to transform the raw logits into a probability distribution while maintaining certain characteristics:

1. **Interpretability:** Softmax ensures that the output is a proper probability distribution, meaning that the values lie between 0 and 1, and the sum of all probabilities is equal to 1. This makes it easy to interpret the output as class probabilities.

2. **Stability:** When working with exponentials in the softmax function, there is a potential for numerical instability, especially when dealing with large or small numbers. The softmax function is designed to handle this instability more effectively, preventing overflow or underflow issues that might occur when directly dividing by the sum of logits.

3. **Smoothness:** The exponential in softmax tends to emphasize the largest logit and suppress the smaller ones. This can be beneficial for training because it encourages the model to be more confident in its predictions.

However, if your main goal is to obtain a normalized probability distribution and interpretability, dividing each logit by the sum of all logits is a valid and simpler alternative. Both approaches aim to achieve the same outcome, and the choice between them may depend on specific considerations related to numerical stability, computational efficiency, or the requirements of your application.
