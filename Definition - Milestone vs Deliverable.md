"Milestone" and "deliverable" are terms commonly used in project management to describe different aspects of a project's progress and completion. While they are related, they refer to distinct concepts.

1. **Milestone:**
   - A milestone is a significant point or event in a project timeline.
   - It represents the completion of a specific phase or a set of related tasks.
   - Milestones are used to track and measure progress, providing a way to assess whether a project is on schedule.
   - Examples of milestones include the completion of a project phase, the successful testing of a key component, or the achievement of a critical deadline.

2. **Deliverable:**
   - A deliverable is a tangible or intangible item that is produced as a result of a project.
   - It is something that can be delivered to the project stakeholders, whether internal or external.
   - Deliverables are the output of project activities and are often used to demonstrate progress or fulfill a project requirement.
   - Examples of deliverables include a completed software module, a report, a prototype, or any other measurable and verifiable outcome.

In summary, a milestone is a point in time, marking the completion of a significant phase or set of tasks, while a deliverable is a tangible or intangible item that is produced as a result of project activities and can be delivered to stakeholders. Milestones are used to track progress, while deliverables are the concrete results of project work. Often, milestones are associated with the completion of specific deliverables, making them interconnected in the overall project management process.
